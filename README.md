Linear Search in Array
This repository contains an implementation of the linear search algorithm in an array. The linear search algorithm is a simple algorithm that searches for a given element in an array by checking each element in the array until it finds a match.

Algorithm:
The linear search algorithm works by iterating over each element in the array and comparing it to the target element. If the target element is found, the algorithm returns True. If the end of the array is reached without finding the target element, the algorithm returns False.

Performance: 

The time complexity of the linear search algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the array. This means that the algorithm will take longer to run for larger arrays. However, the space complexity of the algorithm is O(1), since it only uses a constant amount of memory to store the current index and target element.
